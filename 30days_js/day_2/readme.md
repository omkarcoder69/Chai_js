<h1>Feature Requests</h1>

Arithmetic Operations Script : Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.

Comparison and Logical Operators Script : Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.

Ternary Operator Script : Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
